Those decisions do not always align with Mr. Bannon’s.”</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="1693">Mr. Bannon now works at Breitbart News, a conservative news outlet that has been funded in part by Mr. Mercer. In the letter on Thursday, Mr. Mercer said that he was selling his stake in Breitbart to his daughters “for personal reasons.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="1749">Mr. Mercer could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="1928">Beyond donating to political campaigns, Mr. Mercer was a large financial backer of Cambridge Analytica, a voter-data firm that worked with the presidential campaign of Mr.  Trump.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="512" data-total-count="2440">The hedge fund, commonly known as RenTech, was founded by James Simons, a prominent supporter of Democratic causes and candidates, including Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Mr. Mercer, a former computer coder who worked at I.B.M. before moving to Renaissance, is known for being shy and idiosyncratic. A model-train aficionado, he hosts a well-known holiday costume party at his Long Island estate, known as Owl’s Nest, that has attracted guests including, last year, Mr. Trump and his top advisers.</p><figure class="media twitter embedded layout-horizontal-inset"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
