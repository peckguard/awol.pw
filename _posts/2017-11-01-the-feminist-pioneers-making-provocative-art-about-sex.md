While other feminists of their era were embracing “central core” imagery related to the womb or vulva and reclaiming traditionally female crafts like needlepoint, these artists demanded attention the way men did — through shock and awe.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1058" data-total-count="5748">Bernstein’s colossal drawings of screws, which unambiguously resemble erect penises, provoked a kind of castration anxiety. “One dealer told me that my work made men of his age feel uncomfortable,” she says. One of her works was censored from a show of women’s art at the Museum of the Philadelphia Civic Center in 1974 after its director, John Pierron, claimed that it “offends me on behalf of the children of this city.” In the late 1960s, a male dealer at Knoedler gallery, then the oldest commercial gallery in New York, told Juanita McNeely that the slides of her work she’d shown him — violent paintings of nude women bleeding — couldn’t have been made by a woman. At another gallery, she brought the canvases to prove it, but as she unrolled them onto the floor the dealer kicked them out of his path and walked away. These artists’ work, at the time and ever since, has been an act of announcement, of provocation by existence. They threatened to take up male territory, which museums and galleries then almost exclusively were.</p><figure class="media slideshow promo  embedded layout-large-horizontal" id="slideshow-100000005513073" data-media-action="modal" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/12/t-magazine/tmag-women-slide-8XD8/tmag-women-slide-8XD8-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2017/10/31/t-magazine/the-feminine-mystique.html">

    </figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1367" data-total-count="7115">Although most of these women identified (and still do) as feminists, their work was too outré even for the radical feminism of the 1960s and ’70s, which found its focus in the politics of sexual oppression, and its voice in people like the lawyer and activist Catharine MacKinnon, who argued that “all pornography is made under conditions of inequality.” The artists of this generation didn’t quite fit in with anyone — not women (MacKinnon’s stance meant a brief, uneasy alliance between feminism and right-wing censors), not critics and not other artists: At the time that these so-called blood-and-guts artists were first appearing, minimalism, a nearly asexual style that championed form over feeling, was the dominant trend — leagues away from these women’s lusty, leaky, fleshy aesthetic. Feminists criticized Tompkins for cutting and cropping images from her husband’s pornographic magazines and thus perpetuating male sexist fantasies. (“I was not active in the feminist art movement,” she says. “I couldn’t find it. Nobody told me where the meetings were.”) Bernstein, now 75, was a member of the all-woman cooperative gallery A.I.R., which was founded in 1972 and is still active, but she too never felt the movement embraced her. “I observed men and their behavior. A lot of feminists didn’t take that as being feminism.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="534" data-total-count="7649">Especially scandalizing was the fact that many of the women — who are almost exclusively heterosexual — made men the objects of desire. When Sylvia Sleigh’s 1975 portrait of a young nude man went on view at the Bronx Museum, then housed in a room of a courthouse, a judge complained about the “explicit male nudity in the corridor of a public courthouse.” The curator wondered in response why he had never complained before about the “coyly draped, bare-breasted females” that adorned the elevators of the same building.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="560" data-total-count="8209">The arrival of queer art in the early ’70s forced the discussion of art and sex — who got to depict it; what it should look like — into the culture at large. Conservatives and the Christian right turned their attention toward gay male artists like Robert Mapplethorpe and David Wojnarowicz, both of whom depicted male desire in their work, and both of whom had been censored by museums. There was a philosophical kinship between these phallic feminists and this first major generation of queer artists, who were all representing anatomy in abrasive ways.</p><figure id="media-100000005513080" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005513080 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/12/t-magazine/tmag-women-slide-E8X0/tmag-women-slide-E8X0-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="917" data-total-count="9126">But while queer art became a cause for museums and galleries — Mapplethorpe and Wojnarowicz were anointed figureheads in a battle between progressive and conservative values, which ultimately exposed their work to wider audiences — these women artists remained obscure. Mapplethorpe’s solo show featuring photographs of male nudes at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., was canceled in 1989 after pressure from members of Congress, but the exhibition was quickly moved to the Washington Project for the Arts. Crowds lined up to see it, and America’s near-return to the 1950s seemed to have been at least temporarily thwarted. And yet the female artists received no new recognition, no new regard. The third wave of feminists that emerged in the ’90s allied with queer theorists and activists of color — and dismissed the previous generation’s feminism as too straight, white and privileged.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="842" data-total-count="9968" id="story-continues-4">NOW, 50 YEARS after these women began making work, the culture has finally caught up to them. These days, pornography streams on phones; many curators determining museum programming came of age reading feminist theory; and there is a diversity, and plurality, of young women artists who have made sex, and the female body, their primary subject, and who have found recognition doing so: 27-year-old Darja Bajagic, who collages hardcore porn with images of murdered women, or 28-year-old Amalia Ulman, whose fictional Instagram personas post selfies in bras and thongs, or 25-year-old Emma Sulkowicz, whose 2014 performance, in which she marched around the campus of Columbia University lugging the mattress on which she was allegedly raped by a fellow student, quickly became an emblem of the current debate surrounding campus sexual assault.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="782" data-total-count="10750">But the sudden popularity of Tompkins and Bernstein is not just about the abundance and easy accessibility of explicit material to which we have all become desensitized. Young women today face some of the same battles that were fought by their mothers and grandmothers at a time when these artists were just beginning their careers. January’s Women’s March was a kind of communion of the previous generations of feminism, a present-tense call to action, but it was also an acknowledgment of the past. The signs carried by protesters contained all the iconography that these artists once traded in and still do — all the explicit depictions of male and female anatomy and bodily functions that had once alienated them had become, over time, the symbols of an age of resistance.</p><figure id="media-100000005513085" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005513085 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/12/t-magazine/tmag-women-slide-WA2Z/tmag-women-slide-WA2Z-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="1828" data-total-count="12578">And while these artists’ shamelessness as young women was outrageous, their shamelessness as old women is revolutionary. What’s perhaps most astonishing is that they never stopped making their work, despite years of disregard: There is something radical about their very stubbornness, their dogged persistence. “In the 1960s and early ’70s, every gallery rejected my work,” says the 78-year-old Carolee Schneemann, who won a lifetime achievement award at this year’s Venice Biennale and is the subject of a retrospective currently on view at PS1. The show was a long time coming. At a notorious 1975 performance at a women’s art festival in East Hampton, Schneemann unrolled a scroll from her vagina and read from it. (The text was about a male “structuralist filmmaker” who criticized the “diaristic indulgence” of her art.) She, like her peers, has bittersweet feelings about their recent recognition. On the one hand, they’re enjoying the success — “Oh my god, it’s fabulous,” Bernstein says. “I take cabs everywhere” — but they’re skeptical of the forces that enabled it. There is a perpetual cycle in the art world of women not being taken seriously until they are old or dead: This was the case with Louise Bourgeois, who only had her first retrospective in 1982, after she turned 70, or the painter Carmen Herrera, who recently had her retrospective at the Whitney ... at the age of 101. These women’s work might be as uncompromising as it ever was, but age, they know, has also neutralized them in men’s eyes, removed some of their sting and danger. Now that they’re postmenopausal, their sexual disobedience doesn’t matter as much to men, who “don’t want to sleep with us anymore,” Schneemann says. “We’re not as threatening as younger women,” says Bernstein.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="697" data-total-count="13275">Other things, though, haven’t changed. Bernstein still lives and works in the same Chinatown studio she’s had since 1967, cluttered with a collection of stuffed animals and toys for her two Persian cats. It used to be crammed with decades of unsold paintings, but now that she can finally afford storage space, the only work present on a recent visit was her new series of fluorescent black-light paintings of testicle-headed Donald Trumps and vagina-faced Hillary Clintons, which are now on view at the Drawing Center in downtown Manhattan. Her signature, prominently scrawled in black cursive letters, appears throughout these works. “I want to make sure they know who did it,” she says.<span class="tombstone"><i class="icon"/></span></p>Continue reading the main story
