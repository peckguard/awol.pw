With budget troubles a chronic fact of life, spending on Medicaid, which has not been expanded, lags. Standardized test scores are among the nation’s lowest. Heart disease and diabetes are endemic.</p><figure id="media-100000005595855" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005595855 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/10/us/10issues2/09issues2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

(The national rate was 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, the most recent year for which federal data is available.) The mortality rate was more than twice as high for black infants as white ones, and in some parts of the state, like Perry or Pickens Counties, the rate was 25.6 and 30.3.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="3450">“I think we really don’t know why it’s going up,” said Grace Thomas, the assistant state health officer for family health services with the state’s Department of Public Health, who called the rates a “key indicator of a health care system’s effectiveness” and said black, Hispanic and poor women were less likely to get the care they need.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="3814">Paris Daves, 24, said it took her several months after she found out she was pregnant last year to get on Medicaid, although she has since drawn support from an organization called Gift of Life, which works to prevent infant mortality in Montgomery. But as a young, single parent, there are other problems, too, like unreliable public transportation and low wages.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="3998" id="story-continues-4">“Minimum wage here is $7.25,” said Ms. Daves, who earns a dollar more than that as a shift manager at McDonald’s. “That’s not enough to pay my rent or take care of my son.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="152" data-total-count="4150">In Haleyville, northwest of Birmingham, the coming shutdown of the hospital looms over the city where, in 1968, the country’s first 911 call was made.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="4418">But you can pick anyplace in Alabama and find issues that feel somewhere between daunting and suffocating. In the Black Belt, named for its rich topsoil, but now a region of widespread rural poverty, people still wonder whether once-plentiful jobs will ever come back.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="4757">Along the Black Warrior River in Tuscaloosa, professionals and university professors worry about Alabama’s reputation and whether companies with money to spend might look elsewhere. Indeed, many fear that the ultimate fallout from the race will be yet another hit to the state’s reputation and attractiveness as a place to do business.</p><figure id="media-100000005595854" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005595854 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/10/us/10issues3/09issues3-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

Instead, most of the conversation was about opioids, economic development and the extension of Interstate 759.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="442" data-total-count="5543">People here know that no single senator can fix all of Alabama’s ills. Many of the state’s troubles, residents acknowledge, must be solved at the State House in Montgomery, not in Washington. But as the campaign for a rare open Senate seat droops to an end that just about everyone here says cannot come soon enough, there is no shortage of regret that the tawdry overtook the tangible, and topics of statewide concern got little hearing.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="5829">“There’s really no other way to put it than a missed opportunity,” said Will Walker, a bank president in Haleyville, the largest city in a county where President Trump won 90 percent of the vote last year. “We’ve had so little discussion about issues, it’s disappointing.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="6078">The state, like its neighbors in the South, is desperate to preserve the economic lifeboats that have emerged in recent decades: big-name foreign manufacturers who put down stakes in exchange for cheap labor, low taxes and lavish incentive packages.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="6309" id="story-continues-5">The economic model has created a strange dichotomy: While Alabama often generates headlines about culture-war battles that outsiders view as hopelessly provincial, the flavor of commerce is increasingly, and proudly, international.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="6641">Airbus, a French company, assembles jets at a state-of-the-art, $600 million factory in Mobile, working with pieces pre-assembled in Spain, Wales, France and Germany. Mercedes-Benz produces luxury SUVs and sedans along Interstate 20 in Tuscaloosa County. Hyundai has been producing vehicles in Alabama since 2005; Honda, since 2001.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="6864">But the strategy only works so well. In 1999, according to census figures, Alabama’s median household income lagged the national median by about $7,800. Today, Alabama lags behind the national median by more than $11,000.</p><figure id="media-100000005595856" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005595856 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/09/us/09issues4/09issues4-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

Addy, an economist at the University of Alabama, said the state still has glaring public sector needs in education, infrastructure, health and prisons.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="7230">“Those are our four major ones,” said Mr. Addy, “and all of them require raising revenues to meet the needs here. But I don’t think the climate is such that we are open to raising revenues much.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="7423">The poor quality of public education, in particular, has long been a concern in a state where the gap between rich and poor residents — and white and black ones — remains a nagging reality.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="7837">The concerns have only seemed to mount with the realization that 21st century manufacturing jobs often require advanced understanding of computer systems: Building a jet is just not the same as running a loom. A year ago, then-governor Robert Bentley, a former church deacon not prone to strong language, at least in public, put the matter in shockingly blunt terms: “Our education system in this state sucks.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="8151">In Escambia County, near the Florida border and the site of Alabama’s death row, Laurine Gentry, 37, said she, too, worried about the state’s schools. This year, she said, the area voted to consolidate some schools, and she worries about her kindergartner, who she says has to ride the bus with high schoolers.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

Her husband, she knows, can take care of himself behind bars, but she said the strain on the system is obvious to her family.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="8649">“My husband’s last probation officer told me he’s sorry he failed me and my children, because he’s got 70 guys to look after, because it’s hard,” Ms. Gentry said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="8816">Indeed, Escambia County is but one place that struggles. Even with the state’s vast presence and a nearby casino, Main Street is sprinkled with shuttered businesses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="9006">“We are 49th or 50th in too many categories,” said Robbie Drummond, 63, a pharmacist. “In Alabama, we always say, ‘Thank God for Mississippi.’ I know they say the same about us.”</p>Continue reading the main story
