The Dodgers will pitch Yu Darvish, and the Astros will go with Lance McCullers Jr. on the mound.</p><figure id="media-100000005528475" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005528475 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/sports/01dodgers-jansen1/01dodgers-jansen1-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

And Verlander, who seemed to be at his big-game best, kept the Dodgers scoreless for five innings.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="1937">It was the type of performance the Astros had in mind when they acquired him from the Detroit Tigers just before midnight on Aug. 31 — the deadline for playoff eligibility.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="2294">Verlander had twice earned a shutout in a decisive Game 5 in a division series (both times against the Oakland Athletics), and he kept the Astros alive in the American League Championship Series last month with a dominating performance against the Yankees in Game 6. He was 9-0 in an Astros uniform and the team had won all 10 games in which he had pitched.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="2538">“There’s something different when you put a major piece like that in your clubhouse,” Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said before the game. “And I think his presence alone gave guys hope and belief that things were going to be good for us.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="2699">On Tuesday night, Verlander allowed only one base runner in those first five innings — a second-inning single by Yasiel Puig that dropped in front of Springer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="2893">By the time the Dodgers came up to bat in the bottom of the sixth, still trailing by 1-0, they had struck out eight times, often overmatched by upper-90s fastballs at the top of the strike zone.</p><figure id="media-100000005528360" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005528360 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/sports/01gamesix-verlander2/01gamesix-verlander2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="446" data-total-count="3339">But then, out of nowhere, the Dodgers broke through. Austin Barnes singled and Chase Utley — who was 0 for 14 in the postseason entering Tuesday — was hit on the foot by a slider that bounced. Chris Taylor then fought off a 1-2 fastball that was in on his hands and clubbed the 97 miles-per-hour pitch over the head of first baseman Yuli Gurriel. The flare double tied the score at 1-1 and sent Utley to third. And there was still no one out.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="3594" id="story-continues-4">Corey Seager followed with a deep drive to right field that brought the crowd to its feet, but the cool air — the first-pitch temperature was 36 degrees colder than it was in Game 1 — held the ball up enough for Josh Reddick to catch it near the wall.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="89" data-total-count="3683">Still, it was a sacrifice fly that gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead and moved Taylor to third.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="3966">Verlander gathered himself and retired Justin Turner on a pop-up, then struck out Cody Bellinger to keep the Astros within a run. But Pederson’s giddy romp around the bases an inning later — after hitting the homer off reliever Joe Musgrove — negated Verlander’s clutch work.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="4117">It was all the most frustrating for the Astros considering they had two opportunities to seize control of the game before the Dodgers got to Verlander.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="4345">Brian McCann led off with the fifth inning with a single and advanced to third when Marwin Gonzalez ripped Rich Hill’s sidearm curveball past a diving Turner at third base. That put runners on second and third with no one out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="4532">Hill then fell behind Reddick by a 3-0 count. But Hill gathered himself and struck out Reddick on three pitches, the last one a curveball. He then struck out Verlander for the second out.</p><figure id="media-100000005528466" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005528466 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/sports/01DODGERS1/01DODGERS1-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="4883">Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts was not going to allow Hill to navigate a third trip through the order. After Springer was intentionally walked, Roberts removed Hill. As he pointed to the bullpen, calling for Brandon Morrow, the crowd booed loudly — remembering how the early hook of Hill in Game 2 had seemed to drain what had been a dominant bullpen.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="4964">Hill was no less pleased, knocking over a row of water-filled cups in the dugout.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="5158">But Morrow — who gave up four runs in a span of six pitches in Game 5 and who has pitched in every game of the series — escaped by getting Alex Bregman to ground out harmlessly to shortstop.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="385" data-total-count="5543">The Astros threatened again in the sixth when Gurriel — who was booed lustily by Dodgers fans in the wake of his racist gesture toward Darvish, the Japanese pitcher, earlier in the Series — singled with two out. Tony Watson relieved Morrow and hit McCann, but was spared when Utley, who had just entered the game on a double switch, leapt at second base to snag Gonzalez’s liner.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="5827" id="story-continues-5">After the Dodgers took the lead, the Astros had yet another opportunity. In the seventh, after Reddick walked, Kenta Maeda replaced Watson and got Evan Gattis, who was hitting for Verlander, to ground into a force out. Springer followed with a single off the glove of Seager at short.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="6060">Bregman followed by hitting a fly ball to center that advanced pinch-runner Derek Fisher to third, but Jose Altuve grounded out to third – with Bellinger deftly scooping Turner’s one-hop throw just before Altuve reached the base.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="148" data-total-count="6208">It was the last chance the Astros had – until Wednesday night, when the Series will end in a manner in which it seemed destined to, with a Game 7.</p>Continue reading the main story
