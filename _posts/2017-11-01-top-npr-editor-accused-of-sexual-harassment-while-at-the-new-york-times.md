        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="1473" id="story-continues-3">Mr. Oreskes is the latest powerful media leader to face accusations of sexual harassment. Since reports began surfacing less than a month ago about allegations of sexual harassment and assault by the entertainment tycoon Harvey Weinstein, the floodgates seem to have opened.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="496" data-total-count="1969">Numerous women have come forward over the past several weeks to accuse men in leadership positions — in industries including media, fashion and publishing — of sexual misconduct. In recent days, men including the prominent political journalist Mark Halperin; the longtime New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier; Hamilton Fish, the president and publisher of The New Republic; and Roy Price, a top executive at Amazon have faced harassment accusations that led to their sudden downfalls.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="2057">NPR’s response underscored the urgency companies now feel to address such allegations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="447" data-total-count="2504">Mr. Oreskes joined NPR in 2015, and The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the women had spoken to a lawyer at NPR, who told them that the organization was reviewing their statements. Before starting at NPR, Mr. Oreskes had worked at The Associated Press and The Times. At The Times, which he joined in 1981, he was a top editor and a chief political correspondent. He also served as the executive editor at The International Herald Tribune.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="2728">In a statement, a spokeswoman for The A.P., Lauren Easton, said the organization “takes any kind of harassment allegation very seriously. If a report is made, it is promptly investigated and appropriate action is taken.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="3112">The women who spoke to The Washington Post said separately that Mr. Oreskes had offered them career advice and then made unwelcome sexual advances toward them. One woman told The Post that Mr. Oreskes had taken out a personal ad about her in the Washington City Paper after she met him at The Times’s Washington offices. Both women said Mr. Oreskes forcibly kissed them on the lips.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="3425">Separately, Jill Abramson, a former executive editor at The Times who once served as a deputy to Mr. Oreskes, confirmed to The Post a description of his questionable interactions with a young female employee then at The Times. Ms. Abramson also said she wished she had said something about Mr. Oreskes’ conduct.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="3546">“If I had to do it again, I would have told him to knock it off,” she told The Post. “I should have stopped him.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="3741">Ms. Abramson declined to comment further to The Times. “I confirmed the one incident I knew of to The Post,” she said in an email on Tuesday, “and have nothing to add beyond what I said.”</p>Continue reading the main story
