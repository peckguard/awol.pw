It was less than two months before the launch of the Tet offensive and the area was teeming with Viet Cong activity. </p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">It was a situation all too familiar to Faas. Earlier that year, he had been caught in a firefight closer to Saigon, near the American base at Lai Khe. Like the soldiers around him, he was trapped; unlike them, he was armed not with a rifle but a camera. Faas was one of the greatest war photographers of his generation, a two-time Pulitzer winner known for capturing precise moments of high emotion and danger on the battlefield. “So many times,” he wrote in his autobiography, “50 Years of Photojournalism,” “from the bottom of my hole, from my trench or from my shelter, I could see at ten meters away a fantastic photograph being formed but, in spite of that, I stayed in my shelter because I knew that shooting would start at the slightest movement and that I could die right there.”</p><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeLarge--1k8xA ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst2/00horst2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"/></figure><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeMedium--3hVlk ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst1/00horst1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"><span class="ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a">Horst Faas was wounded during a rocket attack near a military airfield in December 1967.  An outline of the former airbase is still visible today.

Luckily for Faas, he was quickly treated by military medics and helicoptered to a hospital in Saigon. The surgeons wanted to amputate his leg; only the intervention of The Associated Press’s bureau chief, Ed White, dissuaded them from cutting.</p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">The wounds, despite their severity, didn’t keep Faas out of action for very long. “By early February 1968,” according to Peter Arnett, the New Zealander who was his constant reporting partner at The Associated Press throughout the war, “Horst was back in command — on crutches.”</p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">Faas was not just a combat photographer; by 1967 he was also an editor and mentor for dozens of colleagues across the country. On Feb. 1, the second day of the Tet offensive, one of those colleagues, Eddie Adams, came in with a roll of film showing Lt. Col. Nguyen Ngoc Loan, the deputy chief of the Saigon police, executing a Viet Cong guerrilla, Nguyen Van Lem, on a Saigon street.</p><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeMedium--3hVlk ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst4/00horst4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"/></figure><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeMedium--3hVlk ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst3/00horst3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"><span class="ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a">Eddie Adams captured the execution of Nguyen Van Lem on a street in Saigon, now a commercial thoroughfare (top), in 1968. </span><span class="ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR">Credit</span><span>James Hill for The New York Times (top); Eddie Adams/Associated Press (above).</span></span></figcaption></figure><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">Faas understood immediately what he was looking at as he ran his loupe along Adams’s film: “I saw something that I had never encountered before on the lightbox of my office in Saigon: the perfect photograph — perfectly framed, perfectly exposed, a still image which, I realized, would become the symbol of the brutality of the Vietnam War.” He was right — the photograph won Adams a Pulitzer Prize and became one of the enduring images of the 20th century.</p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">Faas, who was born in Germany, had been honing his sense of photographic judgment since he was 18, when he started work at the Keystone agency in Munich. Before his bosses would let him use a camera, they sent him to sort the agency’s archives, methodically examining endless boxes of negatives, learning in the process to appreciate “the power, or lack of power, in a photograph.” After two years in Germany he was sent to London, where he caught the attention of The Associated Press, which hired him in 1955.</p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">Faas’s assignment to Vietnam was a logical choice, according to Tim Page, another fearless Vietnam War photographer. In 1960 he was in Congo, where he took some of the last images of the independence leader Patrice Lumumba. “There is no school for conflict,” Page said, “only the experience. You can do it or not. Horst could.”</p><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeFull--2bDcJ ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst13/00horst13-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"><span class="ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a">Horst Faas, right, with Malcolm Browne in the Associated Press office in Saigon in 1964.</span><span class="ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR">Credit</span><span>Peter Arnett/Associated Press</span></span></figcaption></figure><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">When Faas arrived in Saigon in June 1962, on the same day as Arnett, the bureau was still very small. Only Malcolm Browne, who had arrived the year before, and the office manager and reporter Hanh Van Tran were on the ground. Faas immediately set about getting the photo operation running — his first move being to turn the office bathroom into a darkroom. As another Associated Press editor recalled, Faas laid down the rule he wanted his photographers to follow: Each of them should be, he said, “a journalist who worked as a photographer.” In return, he expected reporters to act like photographers, too — to appreciate and report scenes, to communicate images, not just events.</p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">The first historic image captured by the bureau came a year later, on June 11, 1963, when Browne, the bureau chief, left the office to cover a protest by Buddhist monks against the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem. In the middle of a busy Saigon street, a monk named Thic Quang Duc set himself on fire. Browne, though a reporter, had a camera with him, and began snapping away. Faas, recounting the episode in his autobiography, cheekily but perhaps deservedly takes part of the credit. “In the Saigon bureau, there were always cameras available for anyone who might need one,” he noted. “The photograph taken by Malcolm Browne … was not the result of luck. He was accompanied by Hanh Van Tran, the Vietnamese journalist, and both of them placed themselves in the spots that I told them to take if such an event was to happen.”</p><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeMedium--3hVlk ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst6/00horst6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"/></figure><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeMedium--3hVlk ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst5/00horst5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"><span class="ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a">The intersection where a monk immolated himself in protest in 1963 references its history.

But he never left, never seemed to tire of the important work he had taken on. He was the consummate professional, driven and ambitious, but never competitive with his colleagues; he supported them and was one of the few male journalists to promote the careers of female correspondents in Vietnam. </p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">I first encountered Faas in December 2001. I was calling the BBC World Service from Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, for a segment on war photography, and he was in the studio in London. But we might never have met face to face if the presenter had not asked for my address in London. It turned out that Faas, who still worked for The Associated Press, and I had homes 50 yards apart, and I could see the windows of his apartment, lined with Asian statues, from my living room. On my next visit he invited me to The Associated Press office and then out to lunch at El Vino, the traditional watering hole of Fleet Street, whose atmosphere he had adored from the moment of his arrival in London in 1953. He was just a few years from retirement, but he still burned with the inextinguishable hunger of a newsman.</p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1">This summer, as I traveled to Vietnam to retrace some of Faas’s journeys during the war and afterward, I found a small a museum near the town of Mo Cay in the Mekong Delta. One of the exhibits was a series of photographs depicting the torture of Viet Cong prisoners. There were quite a number on display, but in the center, absorbing the attention of a visitor, was a photograph taken by Faas in October 1964. It shows a Viet Cong prisoner with a knife pressed hard against his stomach. The prisoner, according to Faas, ended up revealing the whereabouts of an arms cache — then was executed.</p><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeLarge--1k8xA ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst7/00horst7-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"><span class="ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a">A display of war images at a small museum near Mo Cay, in the Mekong Delta.

So why photograph all this? Because we were convinced that <!-- -->these<!-- --> were not isolated cases. It was an ongoing practice. They did not hide it. It took place before our lenses, everywhere and frequently. It was for us an obligation to also show this aspect of the war.”</p><figure class="ResponsiveMedia-media--32g1o ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884 ResponsiveMedia-sizeMedium--3hVlk ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/opinion/00horst9/00horst9-articleLarge.jpg?quality=30&auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><figcaption class="ResponsiveMedia-caption--1dUVu Media-caption--wlc0l ResponsiveMedia-toneOpinion--1X884" itemprop="caption description"><span class="ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a">A South Vietnamese soldier questioning men suspected of being Viet Cong guerrillas in 1962.

Seth Mydans, my colleague from The Times, whose father,<span class="styles-pre--1zpwS">  </span>Carl Mydans, was one of the pre-eminent photographers of World War II, said of covering that war:<span class="styles-pre--1zpwS">  </span>“The press considered itself allied with American war interests and practiced self-censorship within official guidelines. There was a symbiotic relationship between battlefield photographers and the military brass.” No such relationship existed in Vietnam, and journalists like Faas pushed that freedom as far as they could. He showed the war as he saw it, and in doing so became part of a new breed of photographer, one who used the full power of his medium to convey war in all its unvarnished horror.</p><p class="Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1"><em class="styles-italic--2TT1g">James Hill is a contract photographer for The New York Times.</em></p><div class="bottom-of-article"><div class="elementStyles-addendums--1S4tV elementStyles-toneOpinion--19bv1"><div class="elementStyles-item--3LqVB"><strong class="elementStyles-type--1unKw">Correction<!-- -->:</strong> <p>An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a military base near Saigon.
