<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="51" data-total-count="1838" id="story-continues-3">“I just tore toward the door,” Mr. Rucker said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="150" data-total-count="1988">Gonzalo Benitez, a construction worker, said he had been buying food for his family when he heard six or seven gunshots and customers began screaming.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="2099">“A lot of people crying, running fast,” Mr. Benitez, 44, said. “I see a couple of people on the floor.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="124" data-total-count="2223">He and other customers rushed through the aisles to a rear exit door, he said, and had to pound against it to force it open.</p>
