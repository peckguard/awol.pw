There are 3,000 firefighters assembled in Ventura County alone; when they finish their shifts digging firebreaks and hosing down vulnerable terrain, many sleep in tents at the fairgrounds.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="2486">The crews fighting the fire in Ventura include seasonal and permanent personnel from across the state; teams from the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management; and crews made up of prison inmates, who work for a base salary of $2 a day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="2815">They use shovels, chain saws and heavy duty rakes called McLeods to cut through vegetation. One firefighter standing on a blustery hilltop Thursday night had a repetitive task worthy of Sisyphus: monitoring a patch of already scorched hillside and using a garden hose to put out small fires that reignited with each gust of wind.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="163" data-total-count="2978">The Ventura County Fire Department said on Twitter that crews were working “long hours in extremely steep, dry, rugged terrain full of drought-stressed fuels.”</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="402" data-total-count="3380" id="story-continues-4">California has a long history of fire catastrophes. San Francisco burned to the ground at least four times in the years immediately after the gold rush of the 1800s. The state’s Mediterranean climate with its long, arid summers has made it an attractive destination for sun-seeking migrants from wetter and colder parts of the nation. It is also one of the reasons the state is so vulnerable to fire.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="3555">In recent years the size and intensity of fires has increased. Of the state’s 20 largest wildfires over the past century, 13 have occurred since 2002, according to Cal Fire.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="3726">With fires now regularly igniting late into fall and winter, a time that was previously considered the off-season, the department says it needs more trucks and more money.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="103" data-total-count="3829">Cal Fire has spent $500 million since July and is on track to spend the most in the agency’s history.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="82" data-total-count="3911">“We staff to meet the conditions,” said Chief Upton. “But it costs money.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="4121">Chief Upton calls California an “anomaly” compared with other states because of the vast resources that the state puts into fighting fires. There are 1,100 fire departments statewide, according to Cal Fire.</p><figure id="media-100000005595884" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005595884 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/09/us/09calfire3/09calfire3-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

Rhode Island, Alaska, Nevada, Florida and Washington spend more per capita, according to the institute’s calculation. But experts warn that calculating total fire expenditure is difficult because so many agencies are involved.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="4863">As the climate changes and as more homes are built in areas close to nature — and thus more vulnerable to wildfires — there seems no end to the skyrocketing costs of firefighting in California.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="5268">Some experts believe that the emphasis should be to make communities more resilient to fire, rather than buying more firefighting equipment. The furious winds that helped the initial spread of both the wine country fires in October and the current round of fires in Southern California have highlighted the difficulty — and at the peak of the winds, the seeming futility — of trying to stop the fires.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="5503" id="story-continues-5">“Of course you need fire protection, but just responding by getting more engines and aircraft doesn’t work,” said Stephen J. Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University. “Under the extreme conditions the system fails.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="145" data-total-count="5648">Mr. Pyne recommended “hardening communities” in ways that allow the fires to “blow over and around them without incinerating everything.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="5713">“Unless you do that you’re in this endless cycle,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="5931">Chris Mehl, policy director with Headwaters Economics, a Montana research group that specializes in land use policies including fire prevention, said California would be forced into building more resilient communities.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="6166">“This trend is impossible — we can’t keep this up,” he said of the increasingly frequent fires. “But how we build and where we build and the extent and the density — these are all things that are in our control,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="49" data-total-count="6215">Will the firefighters make it home for Christmas?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="107" data-total-count="6322">That depends, said David Clark, a Cal Fire spokesman. “I’ll get home when the fire is done,” he said.</p><div id="addenda" class="addenda">
