        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="415" data-total-count="2430" id="story-continues-3">The amount Mr. Manafort is said to have spent on clothing at a store in New York — $849,000 between 2008 and 2014 — earned a fair amount of mockery and disbelief online. But at least one luxury retailer said that amount spread over six years — an average of $141,500 per year — amounts to a large but not unprecedented annual outlay for a shopper of the 1 percent interested in luxury tailoring and clothes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="2805">“The fact of the matter is, we have many brand enthusiasts who love the made-to-measure process and regularly spend over $100,000 a year with us,” said Sarrah Candee, the senior director of global marketing and public relations for Isaia, the Neapolitan luxury brand, whose suits, most of which sell for $4,000-$5,000, are a mark of pride among the sartorially conscious.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="334" data-total-count="3139">Ms. Candee said that Mr. Manafort had not, to her knowledge, been a client, but others who worked with him did not assess his style as discerning. Alan Flusser, the New York-based men’s wear designer and author, said that Mr. Manafort had first been brought to him through Roger J. Stone Jr., an ally of Mr. Trump’s, in the 1980s.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="3293">Mr. Flusser said Mr. Manafort “was more into the Michael Douglas-Gordon Gekko imagery than the Brooks Brothers, inside-the-Beltway, button-down look.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="103" data-total-count="3396">“He was a little flashier,” Mr. Flusser said, “trying to project an aura of power and success.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="3801">Jay Fielden, the editor of Esquire, said Mr. Manafort’s fondness for House of Bijan reminded him of somewhat edgier pop culture figures. “It’s like he watched ‘Goodfellas’ and then found a tailor who could update that particular kind of sartorial razzle-dazzle,” Mr. Fielden said. “You see a guy like that coming at you and you know he’s either going to shoot you or sell you something.”</p> <figure id="document-paul-manafort-rick-gates-indictment" class="interactive promo  layout-large"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/30/us/politics/document-paul-manafort-rick-gates-indictment.html">

                Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, was indicted on charges including conspiracy, money laundering and other charges. Mr. Manafort's business associate, Rick Gates, was also charged.            </p>

Nabi Nasseri, who owns Art Underfoot, an antique rug gallery, said he had never worked with Mr. Manafort. He was not, he said, Vendor C.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="4285" id="story-continues-4">Mr. Nasseri said that his shop, which is filled floor to ceiling with about 1,000 silk and woolen rugs, some with prices up to $8,900, could not come close to clearing the price tag listed in the indictment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="4363">“I’d have a lot more money if he had been” a customer, Mr. Nasseri said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="4577">Across the street, at J&J Oriental Rugs, Joseph Nabatkhorian, the shop’s the co-owner, was less welcoming: “I can’t talk about that,” Mr. Nabatkhorian said when asked whether Mr. Manafort had been a client.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="4839">Madeleine Mitchell, the gallery director for Doris Leslie Blau Antique Rugs, buys and designs high-end rugs for embassies and hotels. She was skeptical that the rugs were bought purely for show and not to hide money in an expensive item that would grow in value.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="122" data-total-count="4961">“None of my clients would spend $900,000 on rugs,” Ms. Mitchell added, “and they have all the money in the world.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="5288">In the Hamptons, Mr. Manafort’s spending sent mixed signals to real estate observers. Since the early 1990s, a two-plus-acre plot at 174 Jobs Lane in Bridgehampton has belonged to the Manafort family, with a full-size tennis court, half a basketball court, a 720-square-foot outdoor pool, a hot tub and an outdoor pool house.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="5505">Diane Saatchi, a broker at Saunders & Associates, one of the bigger real estate firms in the Hamptons, said that a pool house renovation in 2015 and 2016, priced at $420,000, was “a lot of money for a pool house.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="5616">Of the $800,000 landscaping tab, Ms. Saatchi said that the house didn’t seem “like a manicured property.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="5853">“He could’ve spent that,” Ms. Saatchi said, “but close to $200,000 a year seems expensive given the size and style. I’m going to take a wild guess that if he paid that much just to maintain the landscape, he was overcharged.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="6112">Other expenditures seemed in line with what people pay in the area. Perry Guillot, a prominent landscape architect in Southampton, said he wasn’t surprised to hear that the complaint described the Manaforts’ $112,000 in audio and video installation costs.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="6348" id="story-continues-5">“That doesn’t get you a home theater with lean-back leather seats, a great projector and a popcorn machine,” Mr. Guillot said. “If we’re trying to put him up with the hedge fund guys, those numbers don’t match that story.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="6576">In November 2016, ownership of the Manafort property in the Hamptons was transferred to Sun Breeze L.L.C. Scott Segal, a Manhattan based real estate attorney, said there were a few reasons someone might choose to take that step.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="94" data-total-count="6670">One reason, Mr. Segal said, is that “it’s a way of limiting his liability to the asset.”</p>Continue reading the main story
