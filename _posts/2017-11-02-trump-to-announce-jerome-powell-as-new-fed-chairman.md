        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="1612" id="story-continues-4">He participated in the Fed’s post-crisis push to strengthen the financial system and is not expected to lead the charge in the other direction. Still, he is viewed as more amenable than Ms. Yellen to easing some changes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="1878">“Our view is Powell is the G.O.P. version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation,” said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. He said Mr. Powell was “the easy choice if you want to maintain continuity.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="2051">In replacing Ms. Yellen, Mr. Trump is breaking with precedent. The previous three Fed chairman were reappointed, in each case by a president of the opposite political party.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="2407">Mr. Trump said that he liked and respected Ms. Yellen and on Wednesday called her “excellent.” The Fed under her leadership has sharply reduced unemployment while maintaining control of inflation, coming as close to achieving its Congressional mandate as at any time in its history. But Mr. Trump and his advisers wanted to pick their own Fed chairman.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="2508">Mr. Powell would also be the first Fed chair in four decades who does not have a degree in economics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="2754">The position requires Senate confirmation, but Mr. Powell is likely to attract broad support from the Republican majority. He also won some Democratic votes when he was confirmed as a Fed governor in 2012, and when he was confirmed again in 2014.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="2960">Mr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native. He studied politics at Princeton University, then earned a law degree from Georgetown University and embarked on a career in investment banking at Dillon Read and Co.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="459" data-total-count="3419" id="story-continues-5">In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for his former boss, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Mr. Powell was named under secretary for finance. When Salomon Brothers was caught in an attempt to manipulate the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell spent a long August weekend making phone calls from Cape Cod, arranging for the company’s top managers to resign and for Warren Buffett, a major investor in Salomon, to become chairman of the company’s board.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="3639">Under pressure to account for the shortcomings in regulation that had allowed Salomon’s misconduct, Mr. Powell told a Congressional committee, “There is no question that it can be improved, and improve it we will.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="312" data-total-count="3951">Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997. Over the next eight years, he solidified his fortune. His 2016 financial disclosure form showed a net worth of as much as $55 million. In 2005, Mr. Powell left the firm to focus on public policy issues as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="383" data-total-count="4334">He attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011, when he worked behind the scenes to convince Congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling. The following year, President Obama nominated Mr. Powell to the Fed alongside a Democrat, Jeremy Stein, the Harvard economist. The package deal was meant to attract bipartisan support, and both men were quickly confirmed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="137" data-total-count="4471">Mr. Powell joined the Fed’s board in May 2012, and soon began to express concern the Fed was trying too hard to revive economic growth.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="450" data-total-count="4921">The Fed announced in September 2012 that it would launch a third round of bond buying, purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until economic conditions improved to its satisfaction. The program was backed by Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman at the time, and by Janet Yellen, then the vice chairwoman, who said that it had become clear the Fed had not done enough to reduce unemployment after the 2008 crisis.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="376" data-total-count="5297">A group of three Fed governors, including Mr. Powell, pressed Mr. Bernanke to clarify the Fed’s goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an “off-ramp” for the program. One of the governors, Mr. Stein, described his concerns in public speeches, but Mr. Powell characteristically worked behind the scenes, raising his concerns with Mr. Bernanke in private conversations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="5521">Mr. Bernanke responded by announcing a wind-down plan in May 2013, but fear of a premature retreat caused a “taper tantrum” in financial markets. The Fed ended up continuing the purchases for longer than it had expected.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="5751">Mr. Powell remains a centrist voice in the Fed’s internal debates, arguing for the Fed to end its stimulus campaign at a slow and steady pace. Over the last year, that has placed him solidly among the majority led by Ms. Yellen.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="6155" id="story-continues-6">Indeed, Mr. Powell’s recent comments on monetary policy are basically interchangeable with Ms. Yellen’s recent comments. In a June speech, he said that strong job growth weighed in favor of raising interest rates while weak inflation suggested the need for caution. “If the economy performs about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates,” Mr. Powell said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="159" data-total-count="6314">A survey of 144 investors conducted by Evercore ISI found investors expected that Mr. Powell would push rates modestly higher over time compared to Ms. Yellen.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="372" data-total-count="6686">But Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities, said there is more uncertainty surrounding Mr. Powell’s approach to policy than for other recent Fed chairs, who had more experience in economics before joining the Fed. In particular, Mr. Alexander said, it is unclear how aggressive Mr. Powell would be in responding to a slowdown in the economy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="6881">“I don’t think it’s right to think of Powell as a Yellen clone,” Mr. Alexander said. “In terms of the core issues of monetary policy, we just don’t have much of a baseline for him.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="7181">Mr. Powell gave a detailed account of his views on financial regulation in a June appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. He expressed support for the Fed’s efforts to strengthen regulation since the 2008 crisis, but added that life under the new rules showed opportunities for improvement.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="134" data-total-count="7315">“The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work,” Mr. Powell said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="7473">Mr. Powell made clear that he did not fully embrace the Trump administration’s plans for significant reductions in regulation, released a few weeks earlier.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="7696">“I see it is a mixed bag,” he said. “There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.”</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="71" data-total-count="7767" id="story-continues-7">But, he continued, “There are some ideas that I would not support.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="7997">He could face significant internal pressure, however. Mr. Trump already has chosen Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chairman of supervision, to lead the push against regulation. The two men were colleagues at the Carlyle Group.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="461" data-total-count="8458">On the chopping block: Mr. Powell wants to overhaul the Volcker Rule, which he and other Fed officials regard as overly burdensome. The rule is intended to prevent financial speculation. Mr. Powell said it sat on top of other post-crisis measures designed to limit risk-taking. He said the Fed was working to impose more limited restraints primarily on the largest banks. He added that Congress could achieve the same goals more cleanly through new legislation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="334" data-total-count="8792">Mr. Powell also expressed his support for legislation that would require financial regulators to apply cost-benefit analysis to proposed rules. He said the Fed already was pushing to improve ianalysis of the costs of proposed regulations. “We have an obligation to make our regulation no more costly than it needs to be,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="9034">On the other hand, Mr. Powell pushed back against proposals to allow large banks to borrow a larger share of their funding. He said requiring large banks to raise more capital, or funding from investors, had strengthened the financial system.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="63" data-total-count="9097">“I happen to think we’ve gotten it about right,” he said.</p>Continue reading the main story
