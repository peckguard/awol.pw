        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="137" data-total-count="1356" id="story-continues-2">Ms. Juska, who wrote two other books, died on Oct. 24 in Chico, Calif. She was 84. Her son Andrew said the cause was respiratory failure.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="1536">“I wanted to be the woman I was never able to be, a woman who delights in intimacy with a man, not fears it,” she wrote, adding, “I wanted to get fat on the bounty of men.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="1771">But her book (the title refers to an old slang phrase for a promiscuous woman) is not only an accounting of her belated carnal adventures. Nor is it a real-life precursor to E. L. James’s 2011 best seller, “Fifty Shades of Grey.”</p><figure id="media-100000005530221" class="media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000005530221" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/02/arts/02juska-obit-5/02juska-obit-5-popup.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="2526" id="story-continues-3">Jesse Kornbluth, in an essay for The Huffington Post in 2006, wrote that while Ms. Juska “insists she’s looking for a sexual hookup, you can’t read this book without seeing how much more she really wants — and why the immensity of real desire is more than she can acknowledge.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="2614">“Because,” he added, “she wants what women half her age want: She wants it all.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="2765">Jane Murbach was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., on March 7, 1933. Her father, Edwin, was a doctor, and her mother, the former Helen Wilson, was a homemaker.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="3105">She graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in English and later studied at the University of California, Berkeley, without receiving a master’s degree. Her marriage to Joe Juska, an executive for the federal government in Atlanta, was loveless and filled with arguments, she wrote. It ended in divorce in the early 1970s.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="107" data-total-count="3212">“My ex-husband just wanted me to collapse intellectually,” she told The Times in 2006. He died in 2011.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="3441">Ms. Juska moved to California after her divorce and rarely dated. Instead, she focused on raising her son and teaching high school English in Concord, at St. Mary’s College in Moraga, and to inmates at San Quentin State Prison.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="118" data-total-count="3559">“Except for a couple of unhappy skirmishes, my relationship with men was nonexistent,” she told The Times in 2003.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="3618">“Romantic trouble?” she added. “That was too much.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="3764">But she realized that romantic trouble — and the possibility of falling in love — could result from seeing any of the men who answered her ad.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="4023">“You have to know you’re vulnerable to everything,” she told Mr. Rose in 2003. “I thought I could die. I thought I could be beaten up. I thought I could get a disease. I also thought I could be very happy. I thought that I could have companionship.”</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="4167" id="story-continues-4">A play based on “A Round-Heeled Woman” was written by Jane Prowse and performed in several cities, sometimes with Sharon Gless as Ms. Juska.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="4405">When the play ran in London, with Ms. Gless, the critic Lyn Gardner of The Guardian wrote that “the journey to multiple orgasms is actually one of self-discovery, meaning the play never strays beyond ‘naughty but nice’ territory.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="4688">Ms. Juska followed “A Round-Heeled Woman” with a sequel book, “Unaccompanied Women” (2006) and “Mrs. Bennet Has Her Say” (2015), which The Chicago Tribune called “a brilliant, hilarious, addictively readable reimagining of Jane Austen’s ‘Pride and Prejudice.’ ”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="90" data-total-count="4778">In addition to her son, she is survived by two granddaughters and a sister, Susan Renfrew.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="4857">Her son said in an interview that he had never read “A Round-Heeled Woman.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="92" data-total-count="4949">“I tell people,” he said, “ ‘If <em>your</em> mother wrote it, I’d probably read it.’ ”</p><div id="addenda" class="addenda">
