But Ms. Allred has said the purpose of the lawsuit is not financial, but rather to expose the truth.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="4714">Legal experts point out that Mr. Trump could eventually be deposed or asked to testify, and that if he lied under oath, it would be grounds for Congress to impeach him, as happened with Mr. Clinton.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="483" data-total-count="5197">Marc Kasowitz, Mr. Trump’s lawyer in the case, has made a variety of legal arguments seeking its dismissal. He has argued that the Constitution’s supremacy clause prevents a state court from hearing an action against a sitting president, and that even if the New York court disagreed, it should stay the case during the Trump presidency to prevent “a private witch hunt that could threaten to interfere with the operations of the executive branch and the federal government.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="5463">Mr. Kasowitz has also argued that because the allegedly defamatory statements were made during a national political campaign, they should be viewed as “part of the expected fiery rhetoric, hyperbole and opinion that is squarely protected by the First Amendment.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="5642">The day after Mr. Trump was sworn in as president in January, some of his accusers marched in Washington, drawing cheers from fellow protesters, including the actress Ashley Judd.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="87" data-total-count="5729" id="story-continues-5">“She was telling us to stay strong, that we did the right thing,” said Ms. Taggart.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="5970">Since then, Ms. Judd has helped to unleash an avalanche of accusations against the film producer Harvey Weinstein, leading to his dismissal from his company and inspiring others to go public with complaints about other prominent male bosses.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="6184">Rachel Crooks, who said that in 2005, Mr. Trump kissed her on the mouth when she was working as a young receptionist at Trump Tower in Manhattan, has been heartened to see the recent allegations bring about change.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="90" data-total-count="6274">But she couldn’t help seeing a contrast to how things played out for the Trump accusers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="6354">“You do wonder,” Ms. Crooks said, “how can the country forget about us?”</p>        Continue reading the main story
