The lead author, Kevin Hall, chief of the Integrative Physiology Section at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and his colleagues also presented their work at the Obesity Society’s annual meeting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="1453">Although the study is very small and must be replicated, Dr. Hall said, it is the first to assess obese people years after they lost weight with state-of-the-art methods to measure the calories they had consumed and the amount of exercise they had done.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="1597">The researchers did their measurements when the contestants were chosen, and again at six weeks, 30 weeks and six years after the contest began.</p><figure id="biggest-losers-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-xsmall layout-small"><figcaption class="interactive-caption"><h2 class="interactive-headline">

And physical activity is the key to maintenance,” she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="148" data-total-count="2063">The study also helps explain why that might be. One consequence of weight loss among the Biggest Loser participants was a greatly slowed metabolism.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="2246">The subjects were burning an average of 500 fewer calories a day than would be expected, Dr. Hall and his colleagues found. In essence, their bodies were fighting against weight loss.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="112" data-total-count="2358" id="story-continues-4">Those who kept the weight off “are countering the drop in metabolism with physical activity,” Dr. Hall said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="2660">During the initial weight loss, the equation was different. Then, the difference between how much weight “Biggest Loser” contestants lost could be explained by the number of calories they cut from their diets. The amount of exercise did not distinguish those who lost more from those who lost less.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="152" data-total-count="2812">The contestants competed for six months to see who could lose the most weight. Participants followed a grueling diet and an exhausting exercise program.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="3058">Contestants’ average weight at the start of the show was 329 pounds. At the end, it was 200 pounds, a 129-pound loss. But six years after the study ended, their average weight rebounded to 290 pounds, just 38 pounds less than when they started.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="42" data-total-count="3100">That average, though, hid wide variations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="3325">To learn more, Dr. Hall and his colleagues divided the group of 14 into two. There were the “regainers,” the seven participants who ended up after six years weighing five pounds more on average than they had at the start.</p><figure id="media-100000005524986" class="media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000005524986" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/us/01LOSER2/31LOSER2-blog427.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

The more calories burned, the more carbon dioxide exhaled.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="4121">Some “Biggest Loser” contestants — including the first author, Dr. Jennifer Kerns, now an obesity specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington — said the conclusions of the new study confirmed their own experiences.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="4406">Dr. Kerns, a contestant in Season 3 of the show, says she has managed to keep off 100 pounds only by tracking everything she eats and by exercising on an elliptical cross-trainer for 35 to 40 minutes a day. In addition, her job requires her to walk around the hospital seeing patients.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

She does it with rigid portion control and regular, intense exercise — 45 minutes to an hour a day, Monday through Saturday, doing the Beachbody programs, a challenging combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="5336">Ms. Egbert, who is 30 and lives in Lexington, Ky., says she learned the importance of working consistently to stay thin, even with a slowed metabolism.</p><figure id="media-100000005525707" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005525707 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/us/01LOSER3/01LOSER3-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>
