Carlos Nieves, a spokesman for the police stationed near the scene of the attack, said, “We usually have a large contingent, but added officers will be deployed to the parade in an abundance of caution.” Police officials declined to give the number of extra officers deployed.</p><figure id="media-100000005528330" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005528330 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/nyregion/01parade2/01parade2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

They were visiting from Strasbourg, France, and had spent the day at the Statue of Liberty and the 9/11 Memorial, close to where the attack ended.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="474" data-total-count="2787">Mr. Mayer said they did not know what was happening when they started seeing helicopters swarming. “In France we have the same, in Germany. We live close to Munich,” he said. “It’s just one man, he can take his car. He doesn’t need bombs or guns. You just need a car or a knife. We have to manage this, we have to live with it.” He said his wife was “very nervous” when she saw the helicopters. “She wanted to go back to the hotel, but we decided to go.”</p>

A shiny garbage truck.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="3248">Ms. Ferraguto said she was from Boston and had lived and worked on Boylston Street, near the site of the marathon bombing. “It was a hard week to live through. But I also think it’s important to — ” she said before being interrupted by the sound of a large group of drummers beating out an overpoweringly happy rhythm.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="48" data-total-count="3296">“I didn’t want to miss this,” she went on.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="3575">On Twitter, some criticized the decision not to cancel the parade, saying that the city should be holding a candlelight vigil for the victims, not a parade, but along the route people said the best way to honor the spirit of those whose lives had been claimed was to keep living.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="3881">Anita Durst, who wore a white wedding dress, had thought twice about going because she was the sole adult watching about a dozen 13-year-olds, classmates from the Blue School, a private school in Lower Manhattan. “And that really gave me the willies,” she said. “But the parents were O.K. with it.”</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">
