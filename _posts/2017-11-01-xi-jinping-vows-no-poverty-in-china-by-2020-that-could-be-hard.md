            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="1708">But Mr. Xi’s lofty vision clashes with a harsh reality across much of rural China. In many villages, young people have gone, leaving older residents to fend for themselves. Disparities in education, health care and social services remain stark.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="1959">Even as Chinese cities have turned into playgrounds for the nouveau riche and the swelling ranks of the middle class, nearly 500 million people, or about 40 percent of China’s population, live on less than $5.50 per day, according to the World Bank.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="2310">“The whole idea of socialism was that all Chinese would have a reasonable living standard,” said Kerry Brown, a China scholar at King’s College London. “The nagging concern is that the Communist Party has created billionaires and a strong middle class, and yet there are still a lot of poor people. That seems to be a massive contradiction.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="297" data-total-count="2607">As China works to modernize its economy, it faces the reality that the world’s newest superpower remains a developing nation with a huge poverty problem. Experts say that a slowing economy and loss of manufacturing jobs could add to strains on low-income families, undermining Mr. Xi’s vision.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="438" data-total-count="3045">Under Mr. Xi, who has played up an image as an Everyman, the fight against poverty has become a national mantra. The state-run news media routinely shows Mr. Xi visiting poor villages, sampling the food and water and checking on the health of residents. The evening news is filled with tales of rejuvenated communities, and villagers-turned-entrepreneurs heaping praise on Mr. Xi and the government for providing loans and new apartments.</p><figure class="media video youtube embedded layout-large-horizontal"><iframe class="video-bind" width="420" height="315" src="http://youtube.com/embed/RH1YXHOxwkw?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

Others say that by concentrating on rural areas, Mr. Xi is neglecting the plight of the urban poor, many of whom are rural migrants.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="4579">“The government’s initiatives sound good,” said Qin Gao, a professor at Columbia University who studies Chinese social policy. “But the question is how to sustain poverty reduction. Some people may be looking to quick fixes rather than really addressing poverty.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="257" data-total-count="4836">Mr. Xi has instructed officials to focus on alleviating poverty in rural places like Chashan, where farming conditions are poor, access to basic social services is limited and residents struggle with heart disease and other ailments without a clinic nearby.</p><figure id="media-100000005520592" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005520592 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/world/28china-poverty-4/28china-poverty-4-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="5289" id="story-continues-5">Many residents said they had virtually no income and that subsidies from the government were inadequate.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="134" data-total-count="5423">“There’s no way out,” said Li Chao, 70, a farmer who has struggled with blood clots in his legs. “I can’t earn any money.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="5664">Li Zhi, the trash collector, relies on donations from the few tourists for food and clothing.

Local officials, who are judged partly on their success in improving living standards, are working feverishly to meet Mr. Xi’s deadline.</p><figure id="media-100000005520594" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005520594 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/world/28china-poverty-5/28china-poverty-5-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="6306">Some villages have experimented with rural cooperatives, allowing families to raise production by pooling labor and resources. State-owned banks have provided microloans to help villagers tap into China’s e-commerce boom by selling embroidered dresses and other goods online.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="6613">But the hardest work remains ahead. As many as half of the 43 million people who are officially classified as in poverty could be disabled, according to the government. The campaign must also move into areas that have been chronically poor for generations, including many that are home to ethnic minorities.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="343" data-total-count="6956">Officials in these areas are resettling villagers near cities in government-provided apartments, sometimes against their will. They are handing out cash subsidies to disabled residents. And they are following Mr. Xi’s call for a “targeted” approach, tracking the progress of individual residents on giant bulletin boards in town centers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="7323">Corruption has emerged as a problem, with more than 1,800 people having been investigated last year for embezzling antipoverty funds and related crimes, according to official statistics. Scholars have also cast doubt on the reliability of some data, saying some local officials appear to be understating poverty rates amid intense pressure to meet Mr. Xi’s targets.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="7678">Then there is the fact that Mr. Xi’s campaign is not focused on urban areas. There are more than 200 million rural migrants in China’s cities, where many struggle to receive education, heath care and other benefits because the local government does not consider them residents. Some fall into unemployment or bad health and live in squalid conditions.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">
