<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="27" data-total-count="1885">Josh Reddick, RF (4 for 19)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="29" data-total-count="1914">Justin Verlander, P (0 for 1)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="549" data-total-count="2463">■ Yasiel Puig has guaranteed a victory in Game 6, saying “My team is not going to be finished on Tuesday. There’s going to be Game 7.” It would help if the outfielder could be more consistent at the plate, where he has just three hits in the Series. In his defense, he has made them count. His first was a 10th inning home run in Game 2. His second was a run-scoring single in the sixth inning of Game 3. His third was a two-run homer in the ninth inning of Game 5. In Puig’s other at-bats he is 0 for 18 with no walks and five strikeouts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="547" data-total-count="3010">■ The Astros have won all 10 games that Verlander has started for them since he came over from the Detroit Tigers in a trade on Aug. 31. His combined E.R.A. in regular and postseason starts for Houston is 1.53, and the three earned runs he allowed in Game 2 qualified as his worst start since Aug. 15. Considering the sorry state of Houston’s bullpen they will want him in the game for as long as possible, and Verlander is up to the challenge: He has 55 career games with 120 or more pitches and in those games he was 31-11 with a 2.77 E.R.A.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="474" data-total-count="3484">■ The bullpens have been a huge problem for both teams as fatigue has narrowed the gap between the talented Los Angeles relievers and their maligned Houston counterparts. The managers for both teams may have no option to avoid pitching changes, however, as the Series shifts back to a National League park, thus removing the designated hitter. A true indictment for either bullpen would come if a starting pitcher were allowed to bat late in the game with runners on base.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="3862">■ No batter has turned themselves around more than Cody Bellinger of the Dodgers, who started the Series 0 for 13, and since that point is 4 for 7 with two doubles, a triple and a home run. He has some competition from Jose Altuve of the Astros, who was 3 for 19 going into Game 5, but then exploded with a 3 for 5 performance that included a home run and four runs batted in.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="4347" id="story-continues-6">■ Yulieski Gurriel’s presence in the Series will be seen as somewhat controversial if the Houston Astros win. The first baseman received a five-game suspension for racially insensitive behavior in Game 3, but the decision was made not to enforce the penalty until the start of next season. Yu Darvish, the Dodgers player the behavior was directed toward, has shown remarkable forgiveness, but Dodgers fans are likely not happy that a suspended player drove in three runs in Game 5.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="4" data-total-count="4351">—-</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="4543"><em>Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?
