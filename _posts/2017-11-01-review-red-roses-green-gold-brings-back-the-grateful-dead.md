While I am not a professional historian, these do not appear to be period- or setting-accurate.</p><figure id="media-100000005521771" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005521771 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/29/arts/31redroses2/31redroses2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="264" data-total-count="2289">The zany mood is furthered by Rachel Klein’s bouncy staging and Ásta Bennie Hostetter’s colorful costumes, which land somewhere between Laurel Canyon hippie bohemia and carnivalesque traveling show, with nods to the Dead’s trademark red roses and skeletons.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="460" data-total-count="2749">As manic as the goings-on are, they cannot entirely detract from the music, which borrows extensively the Dead’s two best studio albums, “American Beauty” and “Workingman’s Dead,” both from 1970 — plus, yes, “Touch of Grey.” Arranged by the keyboardist Jeff Chimenti, a longtime satellite in the Dead galaxy, the songs are drenched in folk, country and blues, and rendered quite well by the multitasking cast, which plays all the instruments.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="278" data-total-count="3027">“Truckin’” and “Friend of the Devil” rumble along like the classic bar boogies they are, but the most striking numbers are the quietest ones, such as “Box of Rain,” delivered by Natalie Storrs and David Park, who portray Jackson’s daughter and her love interest.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="176" data-total-count="3203">When the cast comes back for encores, Ms. Storrs belts out the kind of vocal runs that are Broadway’s answer to jammy solos. The world of music is smaller than you may think.</p>
